# Public Folder

## Overview

The "public" folder is a crucial part of your Next.js project structure. It serves as the repository for static assets such as images, fonts, and other files that are publicly accessible on your portfolio website. These assets can be used across your web pages and components.

- **lottie/**: Contains Lottie animations for your portfolio.

## Usage

The assets stored in the "public" folder are designed to be publicly available, meaning they can be loaded directly by browsers. This makes it an ideal location for storing resources like images that need to be displayed on your website. To use these assets in your Next.js project, you can reference them using their relative paths.

Lottie animations, located in the `lottie` subfolder, provide dynamic and engaging visual elements. You can easily incorporate these animations into your website to create eye-catching interactions and visuals.
